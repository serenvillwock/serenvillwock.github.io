Hello!
------
I am a PhD student at [Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/seren-villwock). I work in Dr. Jean-luc Jannink's research group, and in collaboration with [NextGen Cassava](https://www.nextgencassava.org/). I draw on an interdisciplinary background to conduct collaborative research at the intersection of foundational and applied plant science. My long-term goal is to contribute to the enrichment of crop plants with health-promoting compounds. My anticipated graduation is summer 2025.

Research
------
My research explores trait trade-offs in cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) breeding. I am using both quantitative and molecular genetics methods to understand 1) the relationship between carotenoid content and dry matter content in provitamin A biofortified yellow cassava, and 2) the effects of an introgression from the wild relative _Manihot glaziovii_ on yield and fitness.
