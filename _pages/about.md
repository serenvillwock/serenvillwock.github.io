Hello!
------
I am a PhD candidate at [Cornell University](https://cals.cornell.edu/seren-villwock) in Dr. Jean-luc Jannink's research group. I draw on an interdisciplinary background to conduct research at the intersection of foundational plant science and applied breeding. My long-term goal is to contribute to the enrichment of crop plants with health-promoting compounds. My anticipated graduation is summer 2025.

Research
------
My research explores trait trade-offs in cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) breeding. I am using both quantitative and molecular genetics methods to understand 1) the relationship between carotenoid content and dry matter content in provitamin A biofortified yellow cassava, and 2) the effects of an introgression from the wild relative _Manihot glaziovii_ on yield and fitness. I collaborate with the cassava breeding team at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria.
