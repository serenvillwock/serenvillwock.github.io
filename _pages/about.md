About me
------
I am a postdoctoral associate at [Cornell University](https://www.biotech.cornell.edu/about-us/people/58) in the Institute of Biotechnology's Bioinformatics Facility. 
I currently work on the [_VitisxMuscadinia_](https://vxm.uada.edu/) grape hybrid breeding project genetics team with Dr. Qi Sun. 
I received my PhD in Plant Breeding & Genetics from Cornell in 2025, advised by Dr. Jean-Luc Jannink.

Research interests
------
My current research with the [VxM project](https://vxm.uada.edu/) involves:

- Inferring _Vitis_ ancestry in interspecific hybrid genomes using a Hidden Markov Model
- Using amplicon-based microhaplotype marker panels
- Assembling new _Muscadinia rotundifolia_ genomes


My PhD research explored trait trade-offs in cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) breeding,
using both quantitative and molecular genetics methods to understand: 

- The biological basis of the relationship between carotenoid content and dry matter content in provitamin A biofortified yellow cassava
- The effects of an introgression from the wild relative _Manihot glaziovii_ on yield and fitness.
I was fortunate to collaborate with the cassava breeding team at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria for this work.
